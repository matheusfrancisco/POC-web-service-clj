## Understanding about CLOJURE WEB SERVICE

This is my repository with some POC's to understanding
the clojure web services. To check de complexity and
scalability in productions/dev mode.

## Some projects.

[whole-note](./whole-note)
Simple server using Ring and Pedestal.io to see the  folder
simple structuring, how write test to htto server using pedestal,
how run server im repl and prod mode.

[catalog](./project-catalog)
This project is a simple implementation to use Pedestal and check
how works.





* Catalog listing of 'projects' with name, description, etc.

* Will have to define and handle a model expressed in JSON

* Will induce basic resource ops to list, add, and interpret data

* Will be persisted in a database


## GOALS

* Estabilish a pattern that can be scaled and managed

* Define a small problem domain so we don't have to mess with biz logic code

* Include all pieces of a complete stack



#### Stack

* Ring and Pedestal
